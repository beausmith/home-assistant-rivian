An unofficial Rivian integration for Home Assistant, installed through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).

In order to use this extension, you'll need the following information
 - Rivian Username
 - Rivian Password
 - VIN

Your vehicle must be in delivered status and in your posession for this integration to function. The client id and client secret must be obtained outside of this integration and there is currently no official or unofficial way to do this. You can search forums or the [Rivian Discord][rivian-discord]

## Installation

1. Use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download). In HACS add a custom repository by going to `HACS > Integrations > 3 dots > custom repositories` and adding this github repo `https://github.com/bretterer/home-assistant-rivian`. Now skip to 7.
2. If no HACS, use the tool of choice to open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
3. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
4. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `rivian`.
5. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/rivian/` directory (folder) in this repository.
6. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
7. Restart Home Assistant.
8. [![Add Integration][add-integration-badge]][add-integration] or in the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Rivian (Unofficial)".
